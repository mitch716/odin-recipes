    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken and waffles is a classic comfort food dish that combines savory
      and sweet elements. It typically features a crispy, fried chicken breast
      or leg served atop a fluffy, golden-brown waffle. The waffle often has a
      light, airy texture with a slightly crisp exterior, while the chicken is
      seasoned and fried to achieve a crunchy, flavorful crust. This dish is
      commonly drizzled with maple syrup, which adds a sweet contrast to the
      savory chicken. Sometimes, it's also served with a pat of butter or a
      dusting of powdered sugar. The combination of textures and flavors—crunchy
      chicken with soft, slightly sweet waffle—is what makes this dish so
      beloved. It’s often enjoyed as a hearty breakfast or brunch, but its
      appeal has made it popular at any meal.
